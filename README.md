# Kria Robotics Stack (KRS)

The Kria Robotics Stack (KRS) is a ROS 2 superset for industry, an integrated set of robot libraries and utilities to accelerate the development, maintenance and commercialization of industrial-grade robotic solutions while using adaptive computing. KRS provides to ROS 2 users an easy and robust path to hardware acceleration. It allow ROS 2 roboticists to create custom secure compute architectures with higher productivity. KRS leverages Xilinx technology targeting the Kria SOM portfolio to deliver low latency (real-fast), determinism (predictable), real-time (on-time), security and high throughput to robotics.
